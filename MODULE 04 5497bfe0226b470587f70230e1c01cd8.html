If an online payment system does not implement transactions, there could be a situation where the money gets deducted from the user&#x27;s account, but the payment fails to reach the recipient&#x27;s account due to some technical glitch. In such a scenario, the money would be lost and the customer would have to make the payment again. Transactions ensure that such scenarios do not occur and that the database remains in a consistent state at all times.</p><p id="de3a8299-7b4b-4ff6-b11d-424f91ee121b" class="">Here is an example of a transaction in SQL using the <code><strong>BEGIN TRANSACTION</strong></code>, <code><strong>COMMIT</strong></code>, and <code><strong>ROLLBACK</strong></code> statements:</p><pre id="ef3d4288-df27-4b57-aa2c-cc9d1043d5f9" class="code code-wrap"><code>

The idea behind serializability is to ensure the consistency and integrity of the database, even in the face of concurrent access and updates by multiple transactions.</p><p id="5ac1b22a-121a-4952-a070-efe81b4d3d43" class="">A real life incident that illustrates the importance of serializability is a scenario in a stock trading system, where multiple traders are executing trades concurrently. Consider a scenario where Trader A wants to sell 100 shares of a stock for $50 each, and Trader B wants to buy 100 shares of the same stock for $60 each. If these two transactions were executed concurrently and the database did not enforce serializability, it is possible that the final state of the system could be either of the following:</p><ol type="1" id="48a4e2ec-71fe-4d03-8b70-9b5f0488c0f2" class="numbered-list" start="1"><li>Trader A sells 100 shares of the stock to Trader B for $60 each, but the system mistakenly records the price as $50.</li></ol><ol type="1" id="b94fd1fe-fd9b-4ac3-858a-792ae5f40c82" class="numbered-list" start="2"><li>Trader A sells 100 shares of the stock to someone else for $50 each, and Trader B&#x27;s trade is cancelled.</li></ol><p id="a5bd2430-0836-4de3-a6bc-7f6692bcf341" class="">These scenarios are not acceptable, as they violate the integrity and consistency of the database.

The trade can then be committed or rolled back as a single, atomic unit of work.

In a stock market, multiple transactions are carried out simultaneously, and the prices of stocks change dynamically. If there is no proper concurrency control mechanism in place, multiple transactions may try to modify the same stock price simultaneously, leading to inconsistent results. This could have serious consequences, as it could result in incorrect calculations of stock prices and affect the investments made by individuals and organizations.</p><p id="9391d983-3cc1-4e58-af40-761b24c3dfe4" class="">Concurrency control in DBMS refers to the mechanism that ensures the correct execution of transactions in a multi-user database environment.

This will result in the loss of $50, which is not acceptable.</p><p id="c39c3d0a-ec2b-432a-8682-33675f3564c0" class="">To avoid this, the banking system implements a concurrency control mechanism that ensures the integrity of the database. It ensures that only one transaction is executed at a time, and the other transactions are put on hold until the current transaction is completed. In this example, the first transaction to complete will lock the relevant accounts, and the second transaction will wait until the lock is released. This way, both transactions can run without interfering with each other and the integrity of the database is maintained.</p><p id="4ff02923-d9ad-4391-8ae2-f489a9104076" class="">In this way, concurrency control ensures that multiple transactions can run simultaneously without interfering with each other and maintain the integrity of the database.</p><p id="10bbe1c1-64e5-4ebb-a306-0c470536de34" class="">

In a lock-based protocol, transactions must first request and obtain a lock on a database resource before they can modify it. This ensures that only one transaction can access the resource at a time, avoiding the potential for concurrent access and data inconsistencies.</p><p id="07312ec3-87db-4ca0-8d5e-f9d3b2fdfadb" class="">There are two types of locks that can be used in a lock-based protocol: shared locks and exclusive locks. Shared locks allow multiple transactions to read a resource, but not modify it, while exclusive locks give a single transaction the right to both read and modify the resource. Transactions can request locks at different levels of granularity, including individual records, pages, or entire tables.</p><p id="658f8d32-e3a5-40ae-b192-cdd1177521c1" class="">For example, consider a database that stores information about bank accounts and transactions. In this scenario, a lock-based protocol might be used to control concurrent access to the account balance field in the database. When one transaction wants to make a deposit or withdrawal, it would first request an exclusive lock on the account balance. This lock would prevent other transactions from accessing the balance until the first transaction has completed its update and released the lock.</p><p id="bf8e72bc-9fbf-4a69-abd6-93706a1fa169" class="">Overall, lock-based protocols are a commonly used concurrency control technique in DBMS and SQL systems, providing a way to prevent conflicting access to database resources and ensure data consistency.</p><p id="b13dcb26-0282-4870-b76f-fa6381b6007d" class="">
